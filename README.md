# Computational physics project : Lennard-Jones gas/liquid transition modeling 

Exploring the behavior of 2d Lennard-Jones systems under different conditions with the final objective to observe the phase transition via : 

* the implementation of the routines for calculating LJ energies and forces
* the calculation of the Virial pressure and compressibility
* the calculation of the particle mean-square displacements and diffusion constants
* the calculation of the local density
* routines for running individual and ensembles of MD simulations, sweeping parameter space and automatically including all available data sets into plots

**ALL OF THE USEFUL FUNCTIONS ARE IN *library.py*, IMPORT WITH :**

`from library.py import *`
