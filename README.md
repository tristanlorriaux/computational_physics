# Computational physics project : Lennard-Jones gas/liquid modeling 

Exploring the behavior of 2d Lennard-Jones systems under different conditions with the final objective to observe the phase transition via : 

* the implementation of the routines for calculating LJ energies and forces
* the calculation of the virial pressure
* the calculation of the particle mean-square displacements and diffusion constants
* the calculation of the radial distribution function
* routines for running individual and ensembles of MD simulations, sweeping parameter space and automatically including all available data sets into plots
